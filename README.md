# Todo List

Simple todo list application using Django and ReactJS.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- Python3
- Pipenv


### Installing

1. Clone the repository and access the directory using the terminal
1. Source the virtual environment `pipenv shell`
1. Install the dependencies `pipenv install`
1. Navigate into the frontend directory `cd frontend`
1. Install the dependencies `npm install`

## Running

You are going to run the application in two different terminals:
1. In the [backend] directory, while sourced on the virtual environment, run `python manage.py runserver`. This will start Django server on localhost:8000.
1. In the [frontend] folder, run `npm start`. This will start the frontend server on localhost:3000.
